		way. It provides to construct n number of &quot;Panels&quot; where you can spread 
		sources. Each panel is given a name as well as corresponding button on 
		the left-toolbar, a colored circle, to bring it forward. New panel can 
		be created from selecting &quot;New...&quot; from drop-down list on top-toolbar 
		and providing a name in the editing dialog. For this reason you will 
		never need to exit HbIDE and reenter again. It is a big productivity 
		boost.</span> </td>

		<span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000">Yes. Infact this feature 
		had been the one of the main reasons of HbIDEs existance. All you have 
		to do is to enter different environment settings in _ONE_ hbide.env file 
		which resides alongside hbide.ini. HbIDE provides the interface to 
		manipulate this .env settings which can be invoked from right-toolbar 
		icon &quot;Compiler Environments&quot;. Follow the input fields. A template is 
		provided in &quot;hbide.env&quot;, inspect it and you are through. Once hbide.env 
		is ready, you will simply need to switch over the other environment 
		which can be invoked via right-click on a project node in &quot;Projects&quot; 
		tree and point to &quot;Select an environment&quot; and click on listed options. 
		Next step is just to build the project.</span> </td>

		times depending upon the underlying needs. However, you can alter the 
		contents in some sections, i.e., [Files], [Projects], etc., but only 
		before running HbIDE. At exit, it will re-write it again.</span> </td>

		<span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000">Yes. Not so powerful 
		yet, but &quot;yes&quot;. HbIDE embeds two components as the basis of this 
		intellisense, 1. Harbour Documentation, and 2. Project(s) Prototype 
		Tagging. Both these components can be pressed in servive simultaneously 
		and as per need. Both are loaded only when requested. Prototype Tagging 
		extends one step forward as to offer to load only those projects which a 
		developer will be working on during that session. Both components can be 
		aligned on the side corners to provide always-on view of the actual 
		contents. The moment you press &quot;(&quot; HbIDE examines the contents of these 
		components, if the function is available in Harbour Docs, its details 
		are dumped into the viewer, otherwise if the function is contained in 
		the tagged prototypes, it is made current in the list, and a html 
		formatted prototype is displayed as tooltip beneth the current caret 
		position. Code completion tool is almost done with, and probably will 
		make up its presence in the HbIDE soon. </span></td>
